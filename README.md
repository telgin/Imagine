Software is still deep in the prototype phase, so it will be written in Java for the time being. An eventual re-write into C++ would likely increase performance.

## Psuedo-Security Disclaimer/Warning:
While the security within this program should be good enough to keep your friends out of your archives, I have not hired security specialists to look at this software and as such I make no claims or promises about how secure it is. This was just a casual fun project for me. Could I break the security? No. Could a team of security researchers break it? Possibly. I don't know how they would, but that doesn't mean anything. **If you want your files to cryptographically secure, encrypt them before adding them to archives with this software!** The primary usefulness of this software should be from the ability to hide archives, not to secure them outright.
